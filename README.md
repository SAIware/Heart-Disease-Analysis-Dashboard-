# # ‚ù§Ô∏è Heart Disease Analysis Dashboard ‚Äì Power BI Project

## üß† Project Summary

Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of mortality globally, yet many deaths are preventable with early detection and effective management. This interactive Power BI dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of heart disease patients using demographic, clinical, and lifestyle data. The aim is to uncover survival trends, risk factors, and correlations that can support data-driven decisions in clinical research, public health policy, and patient care strategies.

This dashboard is especially useful for:
- Medical researchers and healthcare professionals
- Data analysts working in healthcare
- Students seeking impactful case studies
- Recruiters evaluating data visualization portfolios

## üñºÔ∏è Dashboard Features and Visuals

### 1. **Survival Count and Serum Creatinine by Age Group**
- Shows correlation between high creatinine levels and mortality.
- Highlights risk escalation in elderly groups.

### 2. **Ejection Fraction vs Survival Rate**
- Displays how patients with stronger heart muscle contractions (ejection fraction) are more likely to survive.
- Visualizes decline in average ejection fraction with age.

### 3. **Gender-based Survival Distribution**
- Compares male and female survival trends.
- Useful for gender-specific medical research or interventions.

### 4. **Survival Rate by Age Group**
- Line chart reveals a steady drop in survival rate beyond age 60.
- Indicates need for preventive focus in aging populations.

### 5. **Impact of Risk Factors by Age Group**
- Beautifully layered stacked area chart tracks:
  - Smoking
  - High Blood Pressure
  - Anaemia
  - Diabetes
- Displays which conditions dominate in each age segment.

## üí° Business & Clinical Insights

- Patients aged below 40 have the **highest survival rate (88.89%)**.
- Age group **71+ has the lowest survival and highest comorbidity presence**.
- A **clear inverse relationship** exists between serum creatinine levels and survival outcomes.
- Ejection fraction metrics indicate **heart muscle strength** as a strong survival predictor.
